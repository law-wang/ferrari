Wanting was enough <br>
For me, it was enough <br>
&mdash; august <br><br>

They told me all of my cages were mental <br>
So I got wasted like all my potential <br>
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad <br>
I have a lot of regrets about that <br>
&mdash; this is me trying <br><br>

Only twenty minutes to sleep <br>
But you dream of some epiphany <br>
&mdash; epiphany <br><br>

Time, curious time <br>
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs <br>
Time, mystical time <br>
Cutting me open, then healing me fine <br>
Time, wondrous time <br>
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies <br>
&mdash; invisible strings <br><br>

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace <br>
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves <br>
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same <br><br>
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed <br>
You turned into your worst fears <br><br>
Tossing out blame, drunk on this pain <br>
Crossing out the good years <br><br>
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed <br>
Look at how my tears ricochet <br>
&mdash; my tears ricochet <br><br>
