<b>Wanting</b> was enough <br>
For me, <b>it was enough</b> <br>
<span style="font-family: minion-pro, serif; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;"> &mdash; august </span> <br><br>

They told me all of my cages were mental <br>
So I got wasted like all my potential <br>
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad <br>
<i>I have a lot of regrets about that</i> <br>
<span style="font-family: minion-pro, serif; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;"> &mdash; this is me trying </span> <br><br>

Only twenty minutes to sleep <br>
But you dream of some <b><i>epiphany</i></b> <br>
<span style="font-family: minion-pro, serif; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;"> &mdash; epiphany </span> <br><br>

Time, curious time <br>
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs <br>
Time, mystical time <br>
Cutting me open, then healing me fine <br>
Time, wondrous time <br>
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies <br>
<span style="font-family: minion-pro, serif; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;"> &mdash; invisible strings </span> <br><br>

Cursing my name, wishing I stayed <br>
<b>You turned into your worst fears</b> <br>
Tossing out blame, drunk on this pain <br>
<b>Crossing out the good years</b> <br>
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed <br>
<b>Look at how my tears ricochet</b> <br>
<span style="font-family: minion-pro, serif; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;"> &mdash; my tears ricochet </span> <br><br>
