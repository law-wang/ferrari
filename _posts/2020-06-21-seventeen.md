With old age comes wisdom, they say. "Or at least, it may change the questions we ask," you mutter to yourself. You have had trouble sleeping lately - more often than not, while the rest of your court is sound asleep, you find yourself staring at the ceiling. 

You are getting older, each day closer to leaving this plane of existence. It is folly to fear such things, of course, yet you cannot keep these feelings at bay. Didn't you used to dream of... more? What happened to love?
