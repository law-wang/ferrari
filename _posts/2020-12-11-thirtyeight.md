###### evermore

One for the money, two for the show <br>
I never was ready so I watch you go <br>
<span style="font-family: minion-pro, serif; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;"> &mdash; champagne problems </span> <br><br>

Walk past, quick brush <br>
<i>I don't like</i> slow motion, double vision in rose blush <br>
<i>I don't like</i> that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush <br>
<span style="font-family: minion-pro, serif; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;"> &mdash; gold rush </span> <br><br>

But what would you do if I <br>
Break free and leave us in ruins <br>
Took this dagger in me and removed it <br>
Gain the weight of you, then lose it <br>
Believe me, <i>I could do it</i>
<b><i>If it's all in my head, tell me now</i></b> <br>
<span style="font-family: minion-pro, serif; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;"> &mdash; tolerate it </span> <br><br>

Past me: <br>
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things <br>
Your nemeses <br>
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing <br>
<span style="font-family: minion-pro, serif; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;"> &mdash; long story short </span> <br><br>

The autumn chill that wakes me up <br>
You loved the amber skies so much <br>
<span style="font-family: minion-pro, serif; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;"> &mdash; marjorie </span> <br><br>
