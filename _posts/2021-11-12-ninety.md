###### Red (Taylor's Version)

And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now  <br>
He's gonna say it's love,  <br>
you never called it what it was <br>
<span style="font-family: minion-pro, serif; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;"> &mdash; All Too Well </span> <br><br>

And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue? <br>
Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too? <br>
'Cause in this city's barren cold <br>
I still remember the first fall of snow <br>
And how it glistened as it fell <br>
I remember it all too well <br>
<span style="font-family: minion-pro, serif; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;"> &mdash; All Too Well </span> <br><br>

How long will it be cute, all this crying in my room?  <br>
When you can't blame it on my youth  <br><br>

Lord, what will become of me <br>
Once I've lost my novelty?  <br><br>

And someone else lights up the room? <br>
People love an ing√©nue  <br><br>

How can a person know everything at eighteen   <br>
But nothing at twenty-two?   <br>
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?   <br>
<span style="font-family: minion-pro, serif; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;"> &mdash; Nothing New </span> <br><br>

Too young to know it gets better <br>
I'll be summer sun for you forever <br>
Forever winter if you go <br><br>

If I was standing there in your apartment <br>
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it <br>
I'd say I love you even at your darkest and <br>
Please don't go <br>
<span style="font-family: minion-pro, serif; font-weight: 500; font-style: italic; font-size: 18px;"> &mdash; Forever Winter </span> <br><br>
