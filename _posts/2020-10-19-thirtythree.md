##### Either way, we're not alone. I'll find a new place to be from.

Driving out 

into the sun

Let the ultraviolet 

cover me up

Went looking for 

a creation myth

Ended up 

with a pair of cracked lips

Windows down, 

scream along

To some America first 

rap country song

A slaughterhouse, 

an outlet mall

##### Slot machines, 

##### fear of God
